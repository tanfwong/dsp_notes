# Sampling Theorem
* Suppose that a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is sampled at the
  sampling rate of $f_s$ samples per second to obtain the
  discrete-time signal $x[n] = x(\frac{n}{f_s})$. The frequency-domain
  version of the Poisson sum formula {eq}`e:poisson_f` relates the
  DTFT $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$ of the sampled signal $x[n]$ to the FT 
  $X(\omega)$ of the original continuous-time signal $x(t)$:
  ```{math}
  :label: e:folded_spectrum
  \begin{equation}
  X(e^{j\hat\omega}) = f_s \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}
  X((\hat\omega+2\pi k)f_s)
  \end{equation}
  ```
  where the quantity on the RHS is often referred to as the ***folded
  spectrum*** of $x(t)$. In other words, the DTFT of the sampled
  signal $x[n]$ is the folded spectrum of $x(t)$.
  ```{tip}
  One may extend the Poisson sum formula to include all finite-energy
  and some common infinite-energy signals and FTs based on the
  limiting process with windowing as we did before.
  ```

* From {eq}`e:folded_spectrum`, it is clear that the folded spectrum
  depends on both the FT of the continuous-time signal and the sampling
  rate. The effects of both factors are best explained in
  picture. First, let us introduce the concept of *bandlimtedness*:
  ```{admonition} Notation
  A continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is ***bandlimited*** to $\Omega =
  2\pi B$ radian per second (or $B$ Hz) if its FT $X(\omega) = 0$ for
  $|\omega| > \Omega$. The quantity $\Omega$ (or $B$) is called the
  ***bandwidth*** of $x(t)$.
  ```
* For a simple illustration, consider a bandlimited continuous-time
  signal $x(t)$ whose FT $X(\omega)$ is of real-valued and as shown below:
  ```{image} ../figs/blspectrum.jpg
  :alt: A bandlimited spectrum
  :width: 400px
  :align: center
  ```
  The bandwidth of $x(t)$ is $\Omega$ radians per second, or $B$ Hz.
  To draw the folded spectrum of $x(t)$, we need to consider two
  different cases:

    1. If $f_s > 2B$, then the folded spectrum is as below:
    ```{image} ../figs/oversample.jpg
    :alt: Folded spectrum (oversampling)
    :width: 800px
    :align: center
    ```
    ```{admonition} Notation
    The condition $f_s > 2B$ is referred to as ***oversampling***.
    The sampling rate $2B$ is usually referred to as the **Nyquits rate**.
    ```
    2. If $f_s \leq 2B$, then the folded spectrum is as below:
    ```{image} ../figs/undersample.jpg
    :alt: Folded spectrum (undersampling)
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    ```
    ```{admonition} Notation
    The condition $f_s \leq 2B$ is referred to as ***undersampling***.
    ```

(sec:oversample)=
## Oversampling ($f_s > 2B$) 
* In this case, we can see from the plot that the FT $X(\omega)$ of
  the original continuous-time signal is perserved in the folded
  spectrum $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$. Thus, $X(\omega)$ can be easily
  recovered from $X(\omega)$, or equivalently in the time domain,
  $x(t)$ can be recovered from $x[n]$.

* In the frequency domain, the ideal reconstruction process is simply:
  1. Cut out the period of the folded spectrum $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$
     over $[-\pi, \pi)$ and scale it by $\frac{1}{f_s}$.
  2. Substitute $\hat\omega = \frac{\omega}{f_s}$ in the cut-out and
     scaled period of  $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$ to convert it to the FT
     $\tilde{X}(\omega)$ of the reconstructed continuous-time signal
     $\tilde{x}(t)$, i.e.,
   ```{math}
     :label: e:cutfold
     \begin{equation}
     \tilde{X}(\omega)
     =
     \begin{cases}
     \frac{1}{f_s} X\left( e^{j\frac{\omega}{f_s}} \right), 
     & \text{if } -\pi f_s \leq \omega < \pi f_s
     \\
     0, & \text{otherwise.}
     \end{cases}
     \end{equation}
   ```
    Since $X(\omega) = 0$ for $|\omega| > \Omega$ ($x(t)$ is
    bandlimited to $\Omega$) and $\pi f_s > \Omega$, we have $\tilde{X}(\omega) =
    X(\omega)$, which of course implies $\tilde{x}(t) = x(t)$ in the
    time domain.

* Let us reconsider the ideal reconstruction steps above from a
  time-domain perspective:
  ```{math}
  :label: e:interpolation
  \begin{align}
  \tilde{x}(t) 
  &= 
  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \tilde{X}(\omega) e^{j\omega
  t} \, d\omega
  \\
  &=
  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi f_s}^{\pi f_s}
  \frac{1}{f_s} X\left( e^{j\frac{\omega}{f_s}} \right) e^{j\omega
  t} \, d\omega
  \\
  &=
  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi f_s}^{\pi f_s} \left(
  \frac{1}{f_s} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\frac{\omega n}{f_s}}
  \right) e^{j\omega t} \, d\omega
  \\
  &=
  \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi f_s}^{\pi f_s}
  \frac{1}{f_s}  e^{j\omega \left( t - \frac{n}{f_s} \right)} \, d\omega
  \\
  &=
   \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]  \cdot \frac{\sin\left( \pi f_s
  (t-\frac{n}{f_s}) \right)}{  \pi f_s (t-\frac{n}{f_s})}
  \end{align}
  ```
  Since $\tilde{x}(t)=x(t)$ if $\pi f_s > \Omega$, we obtain the
  following result which is usually referred to as the ***sampling
  theorem***:
  ```{admonition} Sampling Theorem
  :class: tip
  Consider sampling a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ that is bandlimited to $B$ Hz
  at the sampling rate of $f_s$ samples per second to
  obtain the discrete-time signal $x[n] = x(\frac{n}{f_s})$. If $f_s >
  2B$, then
  ~~~{math}
  :label: e:sampthm
  \begin{equation}
  x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \, \text{sinc} \left( \pi f_s
  (t-\frac{n}{f_s}) \right)
  \end{equation}
  ~~~
  where $\text{sinc}(t) = \frac{\sin t}{t}$.
  ```

* To illustrate the sampling theorem in picture, let us first plot the
  sinc kernel (signal) $\text{sinc}(\pi f_s t)$:
  ```{image} ../figs/sinc.png
  :alt: sinc kernel
  :width: 600px
  :align: center
  ```
  The sampling theorem says that the original continuous-time signal
  $x(t)$ can be reconstructed by interpolating the discrete-time (sampled)
  signal $x[n]$ using the sinc kernel as long as we oversample:
  ```{image} ../figs/sampthm.png
  :alt: Interpolation using the sinc kernel
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  ```

* In practice, we can't use the ideal sinc kernel to perform
  interpolation because the length (support) of the sinc kernel is
  infinite. We have to approximate the reconstruction by using a
  truncated version of the sinc kernel or other kernels of finite support:
  - **zero-order hold**: rectangular kernel 
    $\begin{cases} 
    1, & \text{if } |t| < \frac{1}{2f_s} \\ 
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}$
  - **first-order hold (linear interpolation)**: triangular kernel 
    $\begin{cases} 
    1 - f_s |t|, & \text{if } |t| < \frac{1}{f_s} \\ 
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}$

* A typical practical implementation employs zero-order hold
  interpolation and then passes the reconstructed signal through an
  analog lowpass filter to further smooth it. The combination of the
  zero-order hold interpolation and lowpass filtering is equivalent to
  using an interpolation kernel that is the convolution between the
  rectangular kernel and the impulse response of the lowpass filter.
  
(sec:undersample)=
## Undersampling ($f_s \leq 2B$) 

* In this case, we see from the plot of the folded spectrum that the
  frequency-shifted copies of $X(\omega)$ superimpose on each
  other. This phenomenon is usually called ***aliasing***. Thus,
  $X(\omega)$ cannot be recovered from the folded spectrum using the
  simple steps in the case of oversampling because $\tilde{X}(\omega)
  \neq X(\omega)$.

* Nevertheless, the interpolation formula in {eq}`e:interpolation` is
  still valid, but $\tilde{x}(t) \neq x(t)$. The reconstructed signal
  $\tilde{x}(t)$ given by {eq}`e:interpolation` is called the
  **aliased** version of $x(t)$.
  ```{caution}
  Note that undersampling $x(t)$ doesn't necessarily means that there
  is no possibility of recovering it from the sampled signal
  $x[n]$. However, to be able to do so may require $x(t)$ to have some special
  structures and more significant signal processing.
  ```

* In practice, to avoid the "uncontrolled" effects of aliasing, the
  continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is usually passed through an analog
  lowpass filter with cutoff frequency $\frac{f_s}{2}$ Hz to remove
  any frequency components in $x(t)$ that are above $\frac{f_s}{2}$ Hz
  before sampling. The lowpassed signal then will not suffer from
  aliasing. The analog lowpass filter is often called an
  ***antialiasing filter***.  Of course, we may only reconstruct the
  lowpassed version of $x(t)$ from the sampled signal. Nevertheless,
  applying the antialiasing filter allows us to control the distortion
  we may suffer from potential undersampling. 

(sec:nyquistzone)=
## Nyquist Zone Sampling of Bandpass Signal
* In some situations, we may be able to turn the undesirable
  phenomenon of aliasing into an advantage. One such situation is the
  undersampling of a bandpass continuous-time signal.

* First, we have to define what a *bandpass continuous-time signal* is:
  ```{admonition} Notation
  A (real-valued) continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is 
  ***bandpass*** with a center
  frequency at $\omega_0=2\pi f_0$ radian per second (or $f_0$ Hz) and
  a bandwidth of $\Omega =
  2\pi B$ radian per second (or $B$ Hz) if its FT $X(\omega) = 0$ for
  $|\omega| \notin [\omega_0 - \frac{\Omega}{2}, \omega_0 + \frac{\Omega}{2}]$. 
  ```
* Clearly, the Nyquist rate of the bandpass signal $x(t)$ is $2f_0+B$
  Hz. We must sample $x(t)$ at above $2f_0+B$ sps to avoid
  aliasing. Nevertheless, sampling of the bandpass signal $x(t)$ is a
  situation in which we may want to deliberately undersample in order to
  exploit aliasing to our advantage.

* Consider undersampling $x(t)$ with at the sampling rate $f_s$ satisfying the condition
  $f_0 + \frac{B}{2} < f_s < 2f_0 -B$. That is, all frequency
  components of $x(t)$ lie within the frequency range $(\frac{f_s}{2},
  f_s)$ Hz, which is often referred to as the *second Nyquist zone*. This
  is in reference to that the frequency range $[0, \frac{f_s}{2})$ Hz
  is called the *first Nyquist zone*. A pictorial illustration of a (real-valued)
  bandpass $x(t)$ with its whole $X(\omega)$ lying in the second
  Nyquist zone is as shown below:
  ```{image} ../figs/nyqzone2.jpg
  :alt: The spectrum of a bandpass signal lying within the second Nyquist zone
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  ```

* Applying the folded spectrum formula {eq}`e:folded_spectrum` to
  obtain the DTFT $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$ of the sampled signal $x[n] =
  x(\frac{n}{f_s})$ gives the following folded spectrum:
  ```{image} ../figs/nyqzone2_folded.jpg
  :alt: Folded spectrum of the bandpass signal lying within the second Nyquist zone
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  ```
  We see the all spectrum information in the FT $X(\omega)$ of the
  original continuous-time $x(t)$ is preserved in the folded spectrum
  $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$ of the sampled signal $x[n]$ in this case. That
  is, we may get back $X(\omega)$ from $X(e^{j\hat\omega})$
  (equivalently $x(t)$ from $x[n]$), although the reconstruction
  operation is a bit more complicated than that in the oversampling
  case as shown in {numref}`sec:oversample` above.

* Often, it is more convenient for subsequent processing to "bring"
  $x[n]$ (which is a discrete-time bandpass signal itself)  down to
  the *baseband* by passing its frequency-shifted version 
  $x[n] e^{j(2\pi - \frac{\omega_0}{f_s})n}$
  through an ideal lowpass filter with cutoff frequency
  $\frac{\Omega}{2f_s}$ radian per sample. The resulting signal will
  have the following DTFT:
  ```{image} ../figs/complex_baseband.jpg
  :alt: The spectrum (DTFT) of the complex baseband signal
  :width: 400px
  :align: center
  ```
  This signal at the output of the lowpass filter is often called the
  *complex baseband* version of $x[n]$. It is a complex-valued
  bandlimited signal and retains all spectrum information of the
  original continuous-time $x(t)$, i.e., we can reconstruct $x(t)$
  from this complex baseband signal.

* In practice, we often pass the bandpass continuous-time signal
  $x(t)$ through an analog bandpass filter with passband coinciding
  the second Nyquist zone to remove all its frequency components
  outside of the second Nyquist zone before sampling. This bandpass
  filter acts in the same way as the anti-aliasing filter as discussed
  in {numref}`sec:undersample`.

* It is easy to see that the same aliasing trick theoretically applies
  to bandpass signals lying in any "higher" Nyquist zones. However,
  the sampling operation in practical ADCs is not ideal. The effect of
  non-ideal sampling may be thought of as first lowpass filtering the
  continuous-time bandpass signal and then performing ideal
  sampling. Hence, a bandpass signal lying in a high Nyquist zone  may
  be attenuated (and perhaps also distorted)  too much that the
  sampled version may suffer significantly from the quantization noise
  of the ADC. As a result, Nyquist zone sampling is often limited to
  the second or third Nyquist zone in practice.
