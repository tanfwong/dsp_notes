Foundations of Digital Signal Processing 
============================

This is a set of course notes that I am writing for EEE 5502/EEL 4750,
which is a senior/beginning graduate level course that introduces
students to basic DSP concepts and tools. The main objective is to
help students:
* to understand the essential properties of discrete-time signals and systems,
* to understand the sampling and reconstruction of signals,
* to understand how to use various transform analysis tools to analyze
  digital signals and systems,
* to apply filter design techniques with relevant MATLAB tools, and
* to understand the fundamental principles of multi-rate signal
  processing, and other more advanced topics.
